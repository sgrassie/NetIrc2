# NetIRC2

## History
This repository contains Zer's [NetIRC2](http://www.zer7.com/software/netirc), which was modified by [xPaw](https://github.com/xPaw/WendySharp) to upgrade it to .net 5, and adds support for whois command and some other small updates.

## Modifications
I've added initial support for IRCv3 CAP negotiation and SASL Authentication.
